Over 10 years of hourly energy consumption data from PJM in Megawatts

## PJM Hourly Energy Consumption Data

PJM Interconnection LLC (PJM) is a regional transmission organization (RTO) in the United States. It is part of the Eastern Interconnection grid operating an electric transmission system serving all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.

The hourly power consumption data comes from PJM's website and are in megawatts (MW).

The regions have changed over the years so data may only appear for certain dates per region.

This is a Kaggle dataset which can be found in this link: https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption

I followed in this project the steps of the project management method called CRISP-DM. This method has undergone modifications aimed at the reality of a Data Science project and with that it was called CRISP-DS.

CRISP-DS has the following steps with their respective courts:

### 1 - Business Question
Predict how much energy the power companies in the datasets will consume in the next 12 months.<br>
### 2 - Understanding the Business
This forecast will be used to plan companies in relation to the investments necessary for the expansion and maintenance of their power plants. <br>
